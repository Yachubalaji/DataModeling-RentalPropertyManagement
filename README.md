# Rental Property Management Data Modeling

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a robust data model for managing rental properties. It aims to streamline the operations involved in managing rental units, including tenant management, lease agreements, and payment tracking. The project utilizes MySQL for database management, featuring an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for visual representation of the data model and SQL scripts for database schema creation and data manipulation.

### Project Structure
- `EERRentalPropertyKrishnamurthy.mwb` - MySQL Workbench file containing the ERD.
- `RentalPropertyKrishnamurthy.sql` - SQL script for creating the database schema and inserting initial data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- MySQL Server (Version 8.0 or later recommended)
- MySQL Workbench (for ERD visualization and manipulation)

### Setting Up the Database
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server instance.
3. Import the `EERRentalPropertyKrishnamurthy.mwb` file to view the ERD.
4. Execute the `RentalPropertyKrishnamurthy.sql` script in MySQL Workbench to create the database schema and insert the initial data.

## Usage
After setting up the database, you can start managing rental properties by executing SQL queries for various operations such as:
- Adding new rental units
- Managing tenants and lease agreements
- Tracking payments and maintenance requests
